            <![CDATA[
Complexity is determined by the number of decision points in a method plus one for the
method entry.  The decision points are 'if', 'while', 'for', and 'case labels'.  Generally,
1-4 is low complexity, 5-7 indicates moderate complexity, 8-10 is high complexity,
 and 11+ is very high complexity.

        <description>
The NPath complexity of a method is the number of acyclic execution paths through that method.
A threshold of 200 is generally considered the point where measures should be taken to reduce complexity.
